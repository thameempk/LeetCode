solution : 

public class Solution {
    public int ClimbStairs(int n) {
        if(n <= 1) return n;

        int prev1 = 1;
        int prev2 = 1;
        int current = 0;

        for(int i=2; i<=n; i++) {
            current = prev1 + prev2;
            prev1= prev2;
            prev2 = current;
        } 
        return current;
    }
}
